============================================================
✅ GROQ (llama-3.3-70b-versatile):
The Mirai and Zeus botnets are two of the most notorious malware families in the history of cybersecurity. While they share some similarities, they also have distinct differences in their command-and-control (C2) architecture and potential AI-driven detection methods.

**Mirai Botnet:**

1. **C2 Architecture:** Mirai uses a decentralized C2 architecture, where infected devices (bots) communicate with a central server to receive commands. The C2 server is typically hosted on a compromised website or a dedicated server. Mirai's C2 protocol is based on TCP and uses a simple, text-based protocol for communication.
2. **Communication:** Mirai bots communicate with the C2 server using a periodic heartbeat mechanism, where they send a "hello

 Title: Comparative Analysis of Mirai and Zeus Botnets: Command-and-Control Architecture and AI-Driven Detection Methods

Introduction:
Botnets, such as Mirai and Zeus, are networks of compromised computers that can be controlled remotely to carry out coordinated cyberattacks. This comparative analysis focuses on the command-and-control (C2) architecture of these botnets and potential AI-driven detection methods.

1. Command-and-Control Architecture:

a. Mirai Botnet:
The Mirai botnet is known for its peer-to-peer (P2P) C2 architecture, which makes it highly resil

✅ OPENROUTER (mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free):
 <s> [OUT] The Mirai and Zeus botnets represent two of the most notorious malware families in cybersecurity history, each with distinct command-and-control (C2) architectures and infection vectors. Below is a comparative analysis focusing on their C2 infrastructure and potential AI-driven detection methods.

### **Command-and-Control (C2) Architecture**
1. **Mirai Botnet**
   - **Architecture**: Mirai primarily uses a **peer-to-peer (P2P) model** for C2 communication, where each infected device (bot) communicates directly with other bots rather than relying on a central server.
   - **Communication Protocol**: Mirai employs a **custom protocol** over **UDP** for fast, low

## Research Notes
- **Methodology:** Comparative multi-LLM analysis
- **Reproducibility:** Script available at https://github.com/jasonclarkagain/parallelai-research
- **Ethical Considerations:** Analysis for defensive security research only
- **Limitations:** AI models may have knowledge cutoff dates

## Next Research Steps
1. Validate findings with traditional analysis tools
2. Expand comparison to additional malware families
3. Submit findings for peer review
