✅ GROQ (llama-3.3-70b-versatile):
Phishing attack detection is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, and AI models have been widely used to detect and prevent such attacks. Here, we compare phishing attack detection methods across different AI models:

**1. Machine Learning (ML) Models:**
	* **Random Forest:** Uses a combination of decision trees to classify phishing emails. Accuracy: 95-98%.
	* **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Uses a hyperplane to separate phishing and legitimate emails. Accuracy: 92-96%.
	* **Naive Bayes:** Uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of an email being phishing. Accuracy: 85-92%.

**2. Deep Learning (DL) Models:**
	* **Convolutional Neural

✅ TOGETHER (mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1):
 Phishing attack detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, and AI models have been increasingly used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of detection methods. Here are some comparisons of phishing attack detection methods across different AI models:

1. Machine Learning Models:
Machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVMs), have been widely used for phishing attack detection. These models can be trained on a dataset of phishing and non-phishing URLs or emails, and can then classify new instances as either phishing or non-phishing. Machine learning models can detect phishing attacks with high accuracy, but they can be vulnerable to overfitting and may not perform well

✅ OPENROUTER (mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free):
 Phishing attack detection is a critical cybersecurity task that leverages various AI models to identify and mitigate fraudulent attempts. Here's a comparison of different AI models and their detection methods:

### 1. **Machine Learning (ML) Models**
   - **Supervised Learning**: Models like SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are trained on labeled datasets (phishing/legitimate) to make predictions. Feature engineering (e.g., URL structure, domain age, HTML content) is crucial.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering (e.g., K-means) can identify anomalies without labeled data, useful for detecting novel phishing attempts.
   - **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models (e.g., XG

## Research Notes
- **Methodology:** Comparative multi-LLM analysis
- **Reproducibility:** Script available at https://github.com/jasonclarkagain/parallelai-research
- **Ethical Considerations:** Analysis for defensive security research only
- **Limitations:** AI models may have knowledge cutoff dates

## Next Research Steps
1. Validate findings with traditional analysis tools
2. Expand comparison to additional malware families
3. Submit findings for peer review
