✅ GROQ (llama-3.3-70b-versatile):
The Mirai and Zeus botnets are two of the most notorious malware families in the history of cybercrime. While they share some similarities, they also have distinct differences in their command-and-control (C2) architectures and potential AI-driven detection methods.

**Mirai Botnet:**

1. **C2 Architecture:** Mirai's C2 architecture is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) model. Infected devices (bots) communicate with each other directly, using a distributed hash table (DHT) to store and retrieve information. This architecture allows Mirai to operate without a centralized C2 server, making it more resilient to takedowns.
2. **Communication Protocols:** Mirai uses a custom protocol based

 Title: Comparative Analysis of Mirai and Zeus Botnets: Command-and-Control Architecture and AI-Driven Detection Methods

Introduction:
Botnets, such as Mirai and Zeus, have been notorious for their significant impact on the digital landscape. They are responsible for numerous cyber attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and financial fraud. This comparative analysis will focus on the command-and-control (C2) architecture of these botnets and potential AI-driven detection methods.

## Research Notes
- **Methodology:** Comparative multi-LLM analysis
- **Reproducibility:** Script available at https://github.com/jasonclarkagain/parallelai-research
- **Ethical Considerations:** Analysis for defensive security research only
- **Limitations:** AI models may have knowledge cutoff dates

## Next Research Steps
1. Validate findings with traditional analysis tools
2. Expand comparison to additional malware families
3. Submit findings for peer review
