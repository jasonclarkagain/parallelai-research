✅ GROQ (llama-3.3-70b-versatile):
The Mirai botnet is a notorious example of the vulnerabilities present in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It was first discovered in 2016 and has been responsible for several high-profile DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. The Mirai botnet primarily targets IoT devices such as routers, cameras, and digital video recorders (DVRs) that have default or weak passwords.

**Weaknesses in IoT Devices:**

1. **Default or Weak Passwords**: Many IoT devices come with default or weak passwords that are easily guessable. The Mirai botnet exploits this weakness by using a list of common default passwords to gain access to devices.
2. **Lack of Secure Authentication**: Many IoT

✅ TOGETHER (mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1):
 The Mirai botnet is a significant threat to IoT (Internet of Things) security, as it exploits several weaknesses in IoT devices. Here are some of the key vulnerabilities that Mirai takes advantage of:

1. Default or Weak Passwords: Many IoT devices come with default usernames and passwords, which are often easily guessable or publicly available. Mirai scans the internet for devices that use these default credentials and infects them with its malware. Once a device is compromised, it becomes part of the botnet and can be used to carry out DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.
2. Insecure Network Services: Some IoT devices have

✅ OPENROUTER (mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free):
 The Mirai botnet is a notorious malware that specifically targets Internet of Things (IoT) devices, exploiting their inherent security weaknesses. Here's a detailed analysis of the security weaknesses in IoT devices that Mirai exploits:

1. **Default Credentials**:
   - Many IoT devices come with default usernames and passwords that are never changed by users.
   - Mirai scans for devices using default credentials (e.g., "root" / "root" or "admin" / "admin") and then logs in to take control.

2. **Outdated or Unpatched Firmware**:
   - IoT devices often run on outdated firmware that contains known vulnerabilities.
   - Mirai exploits these unpatched vulnerabilities to gain access to the
