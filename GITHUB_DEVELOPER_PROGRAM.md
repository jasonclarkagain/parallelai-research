# ParallelAI & The GitHub Developer Program

**ParallelAI** is a proud member of the **GitHub Developer Program**. Our tool is built to seamlessly integrate with the GitHub platform, providing powerful AI-assisted security research and analysis directly within developers' workflows.

## About the GitHub Developer Program
The [GitHub Developer Program](https://docs.github.com/en/integrations/concepts/github-developer-program) is for individuals and companies who build tools that integrate with GitHub. As stated by GitHub, membership is open to those who have "an integration in production or development using the GitHub API" and provide a support contact.

### Our Membership
ParallelAI's membership underscores our commitment to:
*   **Scratching an itch:** Building our own tools that integrate with the platform where developers push code every day.
*   **Enterprise readiness:** Utilizing program resources to build and test our application for robust performance.

## What This Means for ParallelAI Users
Our participation in the Developer Program is a mark of quality and integration focus. It enables us to:

1.  **Leverage Official APIs:** Build reliable, well-integrated features using GitHub's official interfaces.
2.  **Focus on Security Research:** Directly apply these integrations to create reproducible security analysis workflows, from analyzing repository issues to assessing code patterns.
3.  **Access Enterprise Tools:** We have the ability to request developer licenses for **GitHub Enterprise Server**, allowing us to ensure compatibility and performance in enterprise environments.

## Identifying Our Integration
